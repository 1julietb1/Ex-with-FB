In this project,my partner and I exercise  exercise some Design Patterns, like - iterator, strategy, and observer, using Facebook API.
We developed these features-  Alone Time, and Find Your Stalker.

•Alone Time - 
	This feature allows the user to see where most of his friends did CheckIn to avoid this place during hours when the user has a desire to be alone. 
	Clicking the "press here to find where not to go!" 
	The place is calculated and is displayed to the user after the weighting is completed.
	Also, the user is shown a list of friends who were there, so he can do his own thing in case they are people he does not want to avoid.
•Find Your Stalker  – 
	- This feature allows the user to see the user who is their stoker,
	after clicking the "Find your Stalker" button it is calculated by the number of likes for the posts and pictures, 
	the comments for the posts, and more.
	When the process is complete, the information about this user is displayed with all the data.
